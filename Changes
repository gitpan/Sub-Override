Revision history for Perl extension Sub::Override.

0.06  Fri Dec  3 2003
    - Ensure that restore() always restores the sub to its
      original state.  This allows a subroutine to be safely
      overridden multiple times.

0.05  Tue Aug 24 2004
    - Removed accidental dependency on Data::Dumper::Simple
      
0.04  Mon Aug 23 2004
    - Fixed bug where explicitly restoring subs whose names were
      not fully qualified would fail.
